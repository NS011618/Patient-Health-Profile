I explained fully the procedure to the patient.,PROCEDURE: , Both sides were done exactly the same way.  After 1% Xylocaine infiltration, a 2 to 3-cm incision was made over the temporal artery.  The temporal artery was identified and was grossly normal on both sides.  Proximal and distal were ligated with both of 3-0 silk suture and Hemoccult.  The specimen of temporal artery was taken from both sides measuring at least 2 to 3 cm.  They were sent as separate specimens, right and left labeled.  The wound was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures and Dermabond.  She tolerated the procedure well.","surgery, headaches, bilateral temporal artery, temporal artery biopsy, temporal arteritis, temporal artery, temporal, biopsy, arteritis"
