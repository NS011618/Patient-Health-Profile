There are no extraaxial fluid collections.  There is no hydrocephalus/midline shift.  Posterior fossa, 7th and 8th nerve complexes and intraorbital contents are within normal limits.  The normal vascular flow volumes are maintained.  The paranasal sinuses are clear.,Diffusion images demonstrate no area of abnormally restricted diffusion that suggests acute infarct.,IMPRESSION: , Normal MRI brain.  Specifically, no findings to explain the patient's headaches are identified.","neurology, mri, diffusion, posterior fossa, axial, brain, contrast, extraaxial, flow, fluid collections, headaches, hydrocephalus, intraorbital, morphology, paranasal, sagittal, sinuses, vascular, weighting, without contrast, mri of the brain, noncontrast, "
