Severe nonischemic cardiomyopathy with prior ventricular tachycardia., Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Pacemaker Interrogation ,"PROCEDURE NOTE: , Pacemaker ICD interrogation.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman who was admitted to the hospital.  He has had ICD pacemaker implantation.  This is a St. Jude Medical model current DRRS, 12345 pacemaker.,DIAGNOSIS: , Severe nonischemic cardiomyopathy with prior ventricular tachycardia.,FINDINGS: , The patient is a DDD mode base rate of 60, max tracking rate of 110 beats per minute, atrial lead is set at 2.5 volts with a pulse width of 0.5 msec, ventricular lead set at 2.5 volts with a pulse width of 0.5 msec.  Interrogation of the pacemaker shows that atrial capture is at 0.75 volts at 0.5 msec, ventricular capture 0.5 volts at 0.5 msec, sensing in the atrium is 5.34 to 5.8 millivolts, R sensing is 12-12.0 millivolts, atrial lead impendence 590 ohms, ventricular lead impendence 750 ohms.  The defibrillator portion is set at VT1 at 139 beats per minute with SVT discrimination on therapy is monitor only.  VT2 detection criteria is 169 beats per minute with SVT discrimination on therapy of ATP times 3 followed by 25 joules, followed by 36 joules, followed by 36 joules times 2.  VF detection criteria set at 187 beats per minute with therapy of 25 joules, followed by 36 joules times 5.  The patient is in normal sinus rhythm.,IMPRESSION:  ,Normally functioning pacemaker ICD post implant day number 1.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, cardiomyopathy, ventricular, tachycardia, pacemaker icd interrogation, millivolts, impendence, interrogation, pacemaker, "
