Inferoseptal and apical transmural scar., Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Stress Test Adenosine Myoview ,"INDICATIONS:,  Ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post inferior wall myocardial infarction, status post left anterior descending PTCA and stenting.,PROCEDURE DONE:,  Adenosine Myoview stress test.,STRESS ECG RESULTS:,  The patient was stressed by intravenous adenosine, 140 mcg/kg/minute infused over four minutes.  The baseline resting electrocardiogram revealed an electronic pacemaker depolarizing the ventricles regularly at a rate of 70 beats per minute.  Underlying atrial fibrillation noted, very wide QRS complexes.  The heart rate remained unchanged at 70 beats per minute as the blood pressure decreased from 140/80 to 110/70 with adenosine infusion.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, stress test, adenosine, adenosine myoview stress test, ischemic cardiomyopathy, spect, cardiomyopathy, electrocardiogram, myocardial infarction, stress test adenosine myoview, adenosine myoview stress, myoview stress test, ptca and stenting, myoview stress, transmural scar, adenosine infusion, septal motion, adenosine myoview, myocardial perfusion, hypokinesis, inferoseptal, ischemic, myocardial, myoview, perfusion, scan"
