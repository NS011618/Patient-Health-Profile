The exercise myocardial perfusion study shows possibility of mild ischemia in the inferolateral wall and normal LV systolic function with LV ejection fraction of 59%, Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Exercise Myocardial Perfusion Study ,"CLINICAL INDICATION:,  Chest pain.,INTERPRETATION: , The patient received 14.9 mCi of Cardiolite for the rest portion of the study and 11.5 mCi of Cardiolite for the stress portion of the study.,The patient's baseline EKG was normal sinus rhythm.  The patient was stressed according to Bruce protocol by Dr. X.  Exercise test was supervised and interpreted by Dr. X.  Please see the separate report for stress portion of the study.,The myocardial perfusion SPECT study shows there is mild anteroseptal fixed defect seen, which is most likely secondary to soft tissue attenuation artifact.  There is, however, mild partially reversible perfusion defect seen, which is more pronounced in the stress images and short-axis view suggestive of minimal ischemia in the inferolateral wall.,The gated SPECT study shows normal wall motion and wall thickening with calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 59%.,CONCLUSION:,1.  The exercise myocardial perfusion study shows possibility of mild ischemia in the inferolateral wall.,2.  Normal LV systolic function with LV ejection fraction of 59%.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, chest pain, cardiolite, ekg, spect, lv systolic function, lv ejection fraction, myocardial perfusion study, spect study, ejection fraction, myocardial, perfusion, ischemia, "
