There are several simple-appearing probable follicular cysts. There is no abnormal flow to suggest torsion on the right.  Left ovary is enlarged, demonstrating a 6.0 x 3.5 x 3.7 cm complex cystic mass of uncertain etiology.  This could represent a large hemorrhagic cyst versus abscess.  There is no evidence for left ovarian torsion.  There is a small amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac likely physiologic.,The uterus measures 7.7 x 5.0 cm.  The endometrial echo is normal at 6 mm.,IMPRESSION:,1.  No evidence for torsion.,2.  Large, complex cystic left ovarian mass as described.  This could represent a large hemorrhagic cyst; however, an abscess/neoplasm cannot be excluded.  Recommend either short interval followup versus laparoscopic evaluation given the large size and complex nature.","obstetrics / gynecology, ultrasound, pelvic pain, transvaginal, cul-de-sac, cystic mass, echo, endometrial, flow, follicular cysts, hemorrhagic cyst, laparoscopic, neoplasm, ovarian, ovary, uterus, transvaginal ultrasound, complex cystic, torsion, "
