FEV1 was 61%.  FEV1/FVC ratio was 72%. The predicted was 70%.  The FEF 25/75% was 45%, improved from 1.41 to 2.04 with bronchodilator, which represents a 45% improvement.  SVC was 69%. Inspiratory capacity was 71%.  Expiratory residual volume was 61%.  The TGV was 94%.  Residual volume was 113% of its predicted.  Total lung capacity was 83%.  Diffusion capacity was diminished.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Moderate restrictive lung disease.,2.  Some reversible small airway obstruction with improvement with bronchodilator.,3.  Diffusion capacity is diminished, which might indicate extrapulmonary restrictive lung disease.,4.  Flow volume loop was consistent with the above and no upper airway obstruction.,","cardiovascular / pulmonary, pulmonary function test, diffusion capacity, dyspnea, fef, fev1, fev1/fvc ratio, fvc, flow volume loop, pft, svc, smoking history, airway obstruction, bronchodilator, extrapulmonary, residual volume, restrictive lung disease, walking, pulmonary function, lung disease, pulmonary, function, lung, capacity"
