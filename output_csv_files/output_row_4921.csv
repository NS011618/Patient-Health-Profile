Post infarct angina., Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Cardiac Cath & Selective Coronary Angiography ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Post infarct angina.,TYPE OF PROCEDURE: , Left cardiac catheterization with selective right and left coronary angiography.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, and the groin was prepped in the usual fashion.  Using 1% lidocaine, the right groin was infiltrated, and using the Seldinger technique, the right femoral artery was cannulated.  Through this, a moveable guidewire was then advance to the level of the diaphragm, and through it, a 6 French pigtail catheter was advanced under hemodynamic monitoring to the ascending aorta and inserted into the left ventricle.  Pressure measurements were obtained and cineangiograms in the RAO and LAO positions were then obtained.  Catheter was then withdrawn and a #6 French non-bleed-back sidearm sheath was then introduced, and through this, a 6 French Judkins left coronary catheter was then advanced under hemodynamic monitoring to the left coronary ostium, engaged.  Cineangiograms were obtained of the left coronary system.  This catheter was then exchanged for a Judkins right 4 coronary catheter of similar dimension and under hemodynamic monitoring again was advanced to the right coronary ostium, engaged.  Cineangiograms were obtained, and the catheter and sheath were then withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory in stable condition.  No evidence of hematoma formation or active bleeding.  ,COMPLICATIONS: , None.  ,TOTAL CONTRAST: , 110 cc of Hexabrix.  ,TOTAL FLUOROSCOPY TIME:  ,1.8 minutes.  ,MEDICATIONS: , Reglan 10 mg p.o., 5 mg p.o.  Valium, Benadryl 50 mg p.o. and heparin 3,000 units IV push.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, selective, angiography, post infarct angina, engaged cineangiograms, coronary angiography, hemodynamic monitoring, cardiac catheterization, catheterization, cineangiograms, cardiac, coronary,"
