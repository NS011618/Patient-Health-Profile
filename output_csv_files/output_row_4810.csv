Peak stress echo imaging shows EF of 75%, no regional wall motion abnormalities.  There was resting hypertension noted, systolic of approximately 152 mmHg with appropriate response of blood pressure to exercise.  No dysrhythmias noted.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Negative exercise ECG/echocardiogram stress evaluation for inducible ischemia in excess of target heart rate.,2.
